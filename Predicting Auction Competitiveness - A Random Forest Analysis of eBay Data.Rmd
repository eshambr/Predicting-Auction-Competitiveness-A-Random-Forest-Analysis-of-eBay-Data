# Abstract

The objective is to build a model to classify eBay auctions as competitive or non-competitive based on a dataset detailing auctions from Mayâ€“June 2004.

# Introduction

This analysis involves pre-processing the eBay auction dataset, applying classification models, and discussing their performances to predict auction competitiveness.

# Data Loading and Preprocessing

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(randomForest)
library(caret)
library(pROC)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
# Loading the data
eBayAuctions_EBR <- read.csv("eBayAuctions.csv")
# Converting 'Duration' to a categorical variable
eBayAuctions_EBR$Duration <- as.factor(eBayAuctions_EBR$Duration)
# Converting 'Competitive.' to a cateforical variables with two levels
eBayAuctions_EBR$Competitive. <- factor(eBayAuctions_EBR$Competitive., levels = c(0,1), labels = c("Noncompetitive", "Competitive"))
# Checking the structure of the dataframe
str(eBayAuctions_EBR)
```

# Auction Data Summary

```{r}
summary(eBayAuctions_EBR)
```

# Methodology

For this analysis random forest classifier for this task due to its robustness and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data effectively.

# Model Building and Validation

```{r}
set.seed(2024)

# Splitting the data into training and validation sets
training_index <- createDataPartition(eBayAuctions_EBR$Competitive., p = 0.75, list = FALSE)
training_data <- eBayAuctions_EBR[training_index, ]
validation_data <- eBayAuctions_EBR[-training_index, ]
```

```{r}
# Training the random forest model
rf_model <- randomForest(Competitive. ~ ., data = training_data, ntree = 100)
# Viewing the random forest model
rf_model
```

# Model Evaluation

```{r}
# Prediction and confusion matrix on training data
training_preds <- predict(rf_model, training_data)
confusionMatrix(training_preds, training_data$Competitive.)
```

```{r}
# Prediction and confusion matrix on validation data
validation_preds <- predict(rf_model, validation_data)
confusionMatrix(validation_preds, validation_data$Competitive.)
```

# Graphical Evaluation

```{r}
prob <- predict(rf_model, validation_data, type = "prob")[, 2]
lift_df <- data.frame(actual = validation_data$Competitive, prob = prob)
lift_obj <- lift(lift_df$actual ~ lift_df$prob)

plot(lift_obj, main = "Lift Chart", xlab = "Percentile", ylab = "Lift")
```

# Conclusion

After analyzing the confusion matrix and the lift chart I can confidently say that the model has a good predictive power, especially in the top percentiles that means, the model is quite effective in ranking the cases by their likelihood of being a positive instance that is being competitive in the auction.By using this model ebay can predict whether an auction is going to competitive or not based on the given variables.
