# Problem Statement

In the dynamic landscape of eBay auctions, distinguishing between competitive and non-competitive auctions is crucial for both sellers and buyers to strategize effectively. However, predicting auction competitiveness remains a challenge due to the multifaceted nature of auction dynamics. This project aims to address this challenge by leveraging a random forest model to analyze various factors influencing eBay auctions. By accurately predicting whether an auction will be competitive, we seek to provide actionable insights that enhance decision-making processes, ultimately improving auction outcomes and user satisfaction on the platform.

# Approach

To address the challenge of predicting auction competitiveness on eBay, I implemented a data-driven approach. I began by collecting and preprocessing auction data, handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables. I then engineered key features like starting price, auction duration, and seller rating. Using the random forest algorithm, I trained and optimized the model, evaluating its performance with metrics such as accuracy and F1-score, and validated it with cross-validation. Once validated, I used the model to predict auction competitiveness, analyzed the results to identify key factors, and visualized the findings. This approach provided actionable insights into eBay auction dynamics, enhancing prediction accuracy and strategy development.

# Findings

The analysis found that auctions with lower starting prices, shorter durations, and higher seller ratings are more competitive on eBay. The random forest model used was effective, showing high accuracy in predicting which auctions would be competitive. Key factors like starting price and seller rating were most influential in determining competitiveness. The model worked well across different data sets, proving its reliability. These insights suggest that sellers can boost auction success by setting lower starting prices, keeping high ratings, and choosing shorter auction times to attract more bidders.
